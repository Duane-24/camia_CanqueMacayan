```SmartSpend: Budget Calculator for Scholars```

Problem Discription: We know that most students receive their allowance or stipend, but it usually disappears fast because it’s spent on things we want, food deliveries, and other unnecessary stuff. Before we know it, there’s nothing left for savings or school needs. That’s why we think it’s important to spend wisely, and a budget calculator can really help us manage our allowance better.

```Features:```
- Calculates how much you have to spend
- Uses percentage like: (20% of allowance is for food)
- Asks if there is extra, and adds it to your Emergency Funds
- Stops and requests changes if the percentage goes above 100%     

```How to run the program:```

1. Make sure to have a Python Interpreter installed.
2. Have a copy of our code.
3. Paste it on your Python application.
4. Press **Run**.
5. Follow the instructions displayed on your screen.
