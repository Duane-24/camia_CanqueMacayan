Title: SmartSpend: Budget Calculator for Scholars

Problem Statement:
Many students have difficulty managing their allowance properly, often spending too much on wants and unnecessary expenses. 
There is a need for a tool that helps them budget their money wisely and develop better spending habits.

Project Objectives:

•To create a program that calculates and tracks a student’s spending based on their allowance and chosen budget categories.
•To help students visualize how their money is divided among savings, necessities, wants, and school needs.
•To provide a simple and user-friendly interface suitable for students with little to no experience in budgeting.

Planned Features:

•Input system for total allowance and percentage allocations for categories 
(Savings, Food, Necessities, Wants, School Purposes and etc.).
•Automatic computation of allocated amounts per category.

Planned Inputs and Outputs:

-Inputs:

Total allowance amount
•Percentage allocations for each category (Savings, Food, Necessities, Wants, School Purposes)

-Outputs:
•Computed peso amount for each category

Logic Plan:
The flowchart is on another file and it shows how the system will process user input, perform computations,
and display the results.
